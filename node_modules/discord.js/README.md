## About

discord.js is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the
[Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

- Object-oriented
- Predictable abstractions
- Performant
- 100% coverage of the Discord API

## Installation

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.**  
Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.

Without voice support: `npm install discord.js`  
With voice support ([@discordjs/opus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/opus)): `npm install discord.js @discordjs/opus`  
With voice support ([opusscript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opusscript)): `npm install discord.js opusscript`

### Audio engines

The preferred audio engine is @discordjs/opus, as it performs significantly better than opusscript. When both are available, discord.js will automatically choose @discordjs/opus.
Using opusscript is only recommended for development environments where @discordjs/opus is tough to get working.
For production bots, using @discordjs/opus should be considered a necessity, especially if they're going to be running on multiple servers.
=======
**Node.js 16.6.0 or newer is required.**  

```sh-session
npm install discord.js
yarn add discord.js
pnpm add discord.js
```

### Optional packages

- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)
- [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discord/erlpack`)
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- One of the following packages can be installed for faster voice packet encryption and decryption:
  - [sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium) (`npm install sodium`)
  - [libsodium.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) (`npm install libsodium-wrappers`)
- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)
- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)

## Example usage

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();
=======
- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)
- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)
- [@discordjs/voice](https://github.com/discordjs/voice) for interacting with the Discord Voice API (`npm install @discordjs/voice`)

## Example usage

Install all required dependencies:
```sh-session
npm install discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
yarn add discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
pnpm add discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```

Register a slash command against the Discord API:
```js
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');

const commands = [{
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Replies with Pong!'
}]; 

const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken('token');

(async () => {
  try {
    console.log('Started refreshing application (/) commands.');

    await rest.put(
      Routes.applicationGuildCommands(CLIENT_ID, GUILD_ID),
      { body: commands },
    );

    console.log('Successfully reloaded application (/) commands.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
})();
```

Afterwards we can create a quite simple example bot:
```js
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
client.on('message', msg => {
  if (msg.content === 'ping') {
    msg.reply('pong');
=======
client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
  if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

  if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {
    await interaction.reply('Pong!');
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
  }
});

client.login('token');
```
